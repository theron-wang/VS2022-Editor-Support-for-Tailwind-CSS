# Getting Started

## Video

## Installation

1. Download from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheronWang.TailwindCSSIntellisense) or directly from the IDE.

	- If you are downloading from the IDE, open Extensions > Manage Extensions and search up 'Tailwind'.

	![IDE Menu](art/getting-started/ide-install.png)

	**IMPORTANT**: For Tailwind v3 projects, `npm` and `node` are required for building and configuration file parsing--follow the [official guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) if you do not already have it installed.

## Existing Projects

2. The extension will automatically try to find a css file with `@import "tailwindcss"` or a JavaScript configuration file named `tailwind.config.{js,cjs,mjs,ts,cts,mts}` in your solution. If not found, however, you can manually set it by **right-clicking your file and selecting 'Set as Tailwind CSS configuration file'**.

	**Extension features will only be enabled if a configuration file is found.**

## New Project

2a.	Once you have created a project, **right click on the project node and click 'Set up and install Tailwind CSS'**:

![Set up TailwindCSS](art/NPM-Shortcuts-1.png)

This will install `tailwindcss` `@tailwindcss/cli` (if needed) and create a new `tailwind.css` file with content `@import "tailwindcss";`.

**Using the standalone Tailwind CSS CLI:**
- If you have the Tailwind CSS CLI installed, you can click 'Set up Tailwind CSS (use CLI)' instead once you have specified the CLI path in Tools > Options > Tailwind CSS IntelliSense > Tailwind CLI path.
- Following builds in the project will use the Tailwind CLI instead of `npx @tailwindcss/cli`
- If you want to switch between `npx @tailwindcss/cli` and the standalone CLI, adjust the `UseCli` property in `tailwind.extension.json`

2b. To configure Tailwind CSS, follow the [official documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) (specifically steps 2, 3, and 5).

----
#### V3

- Include the following in your input css file:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
- Ensure your configuration file has a valid `content` value (e.g. `["./**/*.{html,cshtml,razor,js}"]`)

----
#### V4

- Include the following in your input css file:
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

## Setting Up the Extension

3. _Setting an input file is only necessary for projects using Tailwind v3._ Before you are ready to build, **set your input CSS file**. Your output file will automatically be generated as `{input file name}.output.css`. If you want to specify a certain file, you can right click and click 'Link as Tailwind CSS output file' and select the corresponding input file. **Input files must already be defined prior to selecting an output file.**

4. IntelliSense will display once you type in any HTML or CSS files, including `.html`, `.css`, `.cshtml`, `.razor` files and more, **as long as there is either a `tailwind.config.{js,cjs,mjs,ts,cts,mts}` file or another configuration file specified**.

![IntelliSense](art/IntelliSense-Demo-1.gif)

5. **Your Tailwind file will automatically build on project build**, but you can also manually start the build process under Build > Build Tailwind CSS.

6. **Settings for this extension can be updated in Tools > Options > Tailwind CSS IntelliSense.**

## Customizing Your `tailwind.extension.json` File

- `ConfigurationFiles`: The relative path to your configuration files (i.e. `tailwind.config.js`). This will be parsed for IntelliSense purposes.
	- `IsDefault`: The first configuration file with this set to `true` will be configured as the default. If no default is defined, the first configuration file (regardless of its value) will be set as default.
	- `ApplicableLocations`: The base **directories** in which the configuration file takes effect. This will be used for both IntelliSense and builds, so ensure that your input css file is located in the correct directory.
- `BuildFiles`: A list of files (relative paths) to build when the project is built. This is useful if you have multiple CSS files that need to be built.
    - `Input`: The input css file. Each input file may only have one output file.
	- `Output`: The output css file.
- `PackageConfigurationFile`: The relative path to your `package.json` file. This is used to determine if a custom build should be used, if you defined an npm script to run in the extension's settings.
- `UseCli`: Whether to use the Tailwind CLI or `npx tailwindcss` for building. If you have the Tailwind CLI installed and you have defined its location in the extension's settings, you can set this to `true` to use it instead.
- `CustomRegexes`: Extra regexes to use for completion contexts, sorting, linting, etc., allowing separate options for Razor, HTML, and JS contexts.
	- `Override`: Whether to override the default regexes. If set to `true`, the extension's default regexes will be ignored.
	- `Values`: A list of regexes, in order of priority, to use for each context.
	- **Important notes**:
		- Regexes may use any valid C# engine regex syntax.
		- Your class content must be located in the `content` capture group. For example, the regex `class="(?<content>.*)"` successfully captures `content`.
		- Custom regexes take precedence over default functionality; that is, if a context is matched in both your custom regex and the original regex, the custom regex will be used.
		- It's recommended to thoroughly test your regexes before adding it into your options. Unintended behavior may occur if the regex is too general or if it overlaps with existing functionality.
